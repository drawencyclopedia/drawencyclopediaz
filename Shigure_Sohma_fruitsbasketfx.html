 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Shigure Sohma is the tritagonist of the Fruits Basket series and one of the main protagonists of the Fruits Basket: The Three Musketeers Arc. He is the Dog of the Chinese Zodiac and one of the oldest members of the Cursed Sohmas. He is best friends with Ayame Sohma and Hatori Sohma, and the three make up the Mabudachi Trio. He is also the owner of the house where he, Tohru Honda, Yuki Sohma, and Kyo Sohma live. He is a writer who publishes literary novels under his own name and trashy romances under pen names. While Shigure is depicted as lazy and dirty-minded, he can be extremely sly and manipulative. Having been in love with Akito Sohma ever since she was in the womb, Shigure has stated that he is willing to sacrifice anything or dirty his hands to get what he wants. His main motivation is to break the Sohma Curse so he can free Akito; the God, from the curse and the need to live as a man, so he can have her all to himself. In Fruits Basket Another, he is married to Akito and the father of Shiki Sohma. </p></center>
