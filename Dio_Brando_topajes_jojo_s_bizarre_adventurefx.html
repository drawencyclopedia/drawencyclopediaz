 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Dio Brando is a fictional character appearing in JoJos Bizarre Adventure, a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. He is the main antagonist of the series first part, Phantom Blood, appearing in the debut chapter Dio the Invader , published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump in 1987. He later returns, known simply as DIO, as the main antagonist of the series third part, Stardust Crusaders, now a powerful vampire and the user of the time-stopping Stand known as The World . In the alternate universe of the series seventh part, Steel Ball Run, a character named Diego Brando bearing a resemblance appears as a minor antagonist. The poor son of an abusive alcoholic who worked his mother to death, Dio holds an inordinate amount of enmity toward others. As the series most prolific villain, his defining trait is his staunch ambition, which manifests in a peerless desire for power, no matter the cost. </p></center>
