 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Chlammy Zell is a human who allied herself with the elves in order to try and win the kings contest. This was due to her belief that humans will never be strong enough and must depend on others in order to survive. She is the friend of the elven girl Feel Nirvalen, despite being a slave of Feels family. After Sora bet the Race Piece of Imanity in their game with the Eastern Union, Chlammy Zell challenged Sora in an attempt to win the Race Piece. However, Sora, as he was challenged and thus had the right to choose the game, chose a game in which they would both bet everything they have in parts, tricked her into sharing his memories with her in a game of Othello. After Sora won the game, he returned all memories to the respective owners. After Chlammy had seen Soras memories, she decided to go along with him and his plan. She is a descendant of Nonna Zell, one of the surviving imanity of the Great War. It can be assumed that somewhere between the last 6000 years, her family lost a game to the Nirvalen family, thus becoming slaves up-to present-day Disboard. </p></center>
