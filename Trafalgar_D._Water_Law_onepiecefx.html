 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Trafalgar D. Water Law, more commonly known as just Trafalgar Law and by his epithet as the Surgeon of Death, is a pirate from North Blue and the captain and doctor of the Heart Pirates. He is one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the Worst Generation. He became one of the Shichibukai during the timeskip, but his position was revoked for allying with the Straw Hat Pirates and bringing down Donquixote Doflamingo. Law, like many other pirates, dreams of finding the One Piece. During the timeskip, his bounty increased from BeliBeli200,000,000 to Beli Beli440,000,000 , before it was frozen. After he was expelled from the Shichibukai, Laws bounty was raised to BeliBeli500,000,000. He is one of the central allies of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Dressrosa and Yonko Sagas. He also acts as an ally of Luffy during the movie One Piece: Stampede. </p></center>
