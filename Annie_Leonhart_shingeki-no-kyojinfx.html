 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Annie Leonhartu0026#160; is a graduate of the 104th Training Corps and former member of the Military Police Brigade. Her exceptional skill with swords and unarmed combat earned her the 4th rank, but she is noted to be a lone wolf who struggles to work with others. She possesses the ability to transform into a Titan known as the Female Titan. Trained from an early age by her father, she is selected as one of Marley s Warriors. In the year 845, she is sent on a mission to retrieve the Founding Titan, along with fellow Warriors Reiner Braun, Bertolt Hoover, and Marcel Galliard. As the Female Titan, she serves as a major antagonist prior to her defeat, at which point she crystallizes herself and is left in a comatose state. She was held underground in the custody of the Survey Corps for approximately four years before escaping during a battle between the Military, the Yeagerists, and the forces of Marley. </p></center>
