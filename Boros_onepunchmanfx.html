 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Boros , also called Lord Boros by his subordinates, was the leader of the Dark Matter Thieves, a group of alien invaders responsible for the destruction of A-City. Like Saitama, Boros faced a self-imposed existential crisis, becoming so powerful that no battle thrilled him. His intergalactic travels in search of a worthy opponent led him to Earth, where he was killed by Saitama. Boros is the main antagonist of the Alien Conquerors Arc. </p></center>
