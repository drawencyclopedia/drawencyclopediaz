 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Kyo Sohma is one of the deuteragonists of the Fruits Basket series. After the death of his mother and the rejection from his father, Kyo was adopted by Kazuma Sohma. Kyo is cursed by the spirit of the Cat, an animal who would have been part of the Chinese Zodiac had the Rat not tricked him into missing the ceremony. Kyos true form is actually a grotesque, foul-smelling, monsteru2014 which he turns into when his Juzu bead bracelet is removed. Charismatic and hot-blooded, if a bit socially awkward, Kyo moves into Shigure Sohmas house with Yuki Sohma and Tohru Honda at the beginning of the series, having dedicated his life to defeat his greatest enemy Yuki, the Rat. As the story progresses, Kyo falls in love with Tohru, and in the process, he finds the courage to continue living despite his misgivings and hardships. In Fruits Basket Another, he is married to Tohru and the father of three children, with his oldest son Hajime Sohma acting as one of the main characters. </p></center>
