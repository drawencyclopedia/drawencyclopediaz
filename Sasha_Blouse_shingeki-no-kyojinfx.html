 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Sasha Blouseu0026#160; was a member of the Survey Corps and one of the few former members of the 104th Training Corps, of which she was ranked 9th best, that decided to join the regiment, upon coming into contact with Erens strong desire to eliminate the Titans. A compulsive food hoarder with an overly polite way of speech, Sasha was from Dauper, a village in the southern territory of Wall Rose. </p></center>
