 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Yuki Sohma is one of the deuteragonists of the Fruits Basket series. He is the younger son of his parents and the younger brother of Ayame Sohma by ten years. Yuki is the Rat of the Chinese Zodiac. Known to his classmates with various nicknames such as Prince Charming, Yuki is depicted as an attractive, reserved, and accomplished young man with many admirers. However, due to his broken family, abusive childhood, and the effects of the Curse, Yuki has severe self-esteem issues and feels isolated. He has a fan club at school named Prince Yuki Fan Club, though the result is that Yuki feels further isolated. Yuki lives together with Shigure Sohma, and the two are later joined by Kyo Sohma and Tohru Honda. As he gets to know Tohru, he begins thinking hes in love with her, but later realizes he had been looking for a mother figure in her. Fueled by Tohrus kindness, Yuki finds the courage to stand up to his own weaknesses, and eventually becomes president of the student council despite his misgivings. In the process, he becomes best friends with Kakeru Manabe and falls in love with Machi Kuragi. In Fruits Basket Another, he is married to Machi and the father of Mutsuki Sohma, his son acting as one of the main characters. </p></center>
