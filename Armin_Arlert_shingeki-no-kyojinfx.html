 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Armin Arlert is an elite soldier in the Survey Corps. He is also a childhood friend of Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman, and one of the two deuteragonists of the series. Although he appears to be among the physically weakest of the 104th Training Corps, his intelligence and strategic genius make him an invaluable asset, especially when paired with Hange ZoÃ«. After the battle of Shiganshina District, he took the power of the Titans from Bertolt Hoover and became the Colossus Titan. He is currently an officer in the Survey Corps. </p></center>
