 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Phil is a supporting character of The Promised Neverland. He is a 4-year-old orphan who formerly resides in Grace Field House under the parental care of Isabella. Phil is close friends with Sherry, who he is often seen around with, and Emma, who he looks up to. Phil is, despite his young age, extremely observant and smart. He figured out something was off about the orphanage, and as so, he is asked by Emma to lead all the children four years and younger to stay back in the orphanage while all the children five and above make their escape. This Manga spoiler has not been adapted into the Anime yet. Click on Expand to read. Along with Sherry, Carol, Eugene, Milly and Charlie, Phil now resides in a new orphanage under the care of Yukko after Grace Field House was burnt down. </p></center>
