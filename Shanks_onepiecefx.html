 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Red-Haired Shanks, also commonly known as Red Hair, is the captain of the Red Hair Pirates and a member of the Yonko that rule over the New World. He is also a former member of the legendary Roger Pirates, the only group to successfully conquer the Grand Line, where he started as a pirate as an apprentice. Notably, he is the pirate who inspired Monkey D. Luffy to go on his journey as a pirate, and his crewmate Lucky Roux found the Gomu Gomu no Mi that was accidentally eaten by Luffy. </p></center>
