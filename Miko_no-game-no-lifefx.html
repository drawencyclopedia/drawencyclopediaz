 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Miko (u5debu5973 is the representative of the Werebeasts and rules over the Eastern Union. She lost her real name during the formation of the country when placing it as a wager. Thus, her current namesake is usually written in brackets. She looked down on Imanity at first, but after forming a truce with Sora and joining the Elchea Federation, she starts to have faith in the siblings who represent Imanity. She also ordered Izuna and Ino to follow Sora and Shiro, believing that both can learn more from the siblings. She contains the rare Werebeast ability, Blood Destruction. Miko is voiced by Naomi Shindo in the anime. She is shown in flashes during the Opening Song and Episodes 1 and 4 but made her official appearance in Episode 12. </p></center>
