 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Son Gohan is a half-breed Saiyan and one of the most prominent characters in the Dragon Ball series. He is the elder son of the series primary protagonist Goku and his wife Chi-Chi, the older brother of Goten, the husband of Videl and father to Pan. He is named after Gokus adoptive grandfather, Gohan. Unlike his father, Gohan lacks a passion for fighting and prefers to do so only when his loved ones are threatened.   Nevertheless, Gohan fights alongside the Dragon Team in the defense of Earth for much of his life. </p></center>
