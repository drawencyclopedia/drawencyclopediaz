 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Queen Cersei I Lannister was the twentieth ruler of the Seven Kingdoms and the widow of King Robert Baratheon. She was the daughter of Lord Tywin Lannister, twin sister of Jaime Lannister and elder sister of Tyrion Lannister. She was involved in an incestuous relationship with Jaime, who was secretly the father of her three bastard children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen. After all her children died, Cersei assumed the throne under the name of Cersei of the House Lannister, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, making her the first officially recognized Queen Regnant in the history of Westeros. Her reign came to an abrupt end during the Battle of Kings Landing, where she and Jaime were killed. She was the last monarch to sit on the Iron Throne. </p></center>
