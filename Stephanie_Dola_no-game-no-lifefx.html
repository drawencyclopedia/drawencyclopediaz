 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Stephanie Steph Dola is the granddaughter of the Former King of Imanity. After the kings death, she gambled to become the next queen of the country. Although she was forced by the pledges to fall in love with Sora after losing a game to him in Episode 02, she has since developed feelings for him despite denying these feelings on a consistent basis. In the short story that comes with Blu-ray DVD, Steph actually lost a bit of her mind when she was defeated by Sora again and again. n </p></center>
