 <center><h2>Breve Resumen</h2></center>

<center><p>Ayame Sohma is one of the recurring characters of the Fruits Basket series, as well as one of the main protagonist of the Fruits Basket: The Three Musketeers Arc. He is the older brother of Yuki Sohma by ten years. Ayame is the Snake of the Chinese Zodiac and one of the oldest members of the Cursed Sohmas. He is best friends with Hatori Sohma and Shigure Sohma, and the three of them make up the Mabudachi Trio. Unlike his brother, Ayame is extremely vivacious, flamboyant, confident, and self-centered. He is absolutely obsessed with gaining Yukis love, as he realized his mistakes of completely ignoring Yuki and denying him support in their childhood. As the series progresses, Yuki gradually accepts Ayame as a brother and even tries to understand him. He runs a shop, named after himself; that sells custom-made romantic costumes such as frilly dresses and maid costumes, with the help of Mine Kuramae, his seamstress and lover. In Fruits Basket Another, he married to Mine and the father of Hibika Sohma and Chizuru Sohma. </p></center>
